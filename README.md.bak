# CJsonWrite
A JSON library for embedded systems in pure C99 that allows writing and exporting data to JSON.

## How To Use

CJsonWrite abstracts the JSON format into a concept called JSONNode. Key-value pairs are JSONNodes, array elements are JSONNodes, arrays themselves are JSONNones, even the root of the tree is a JSONNode.

A JSONNode can have multiple types: Null, Bool, Int, Float, String, Obj, and Array.
JSONNodes such as objects or arrays hold a doubly-linked list pointing to their children nodes (or elements, in the case of an array.)

**An example program + makefile was provided in the /example/ folder, which you can build by running `make` in that folder.**
